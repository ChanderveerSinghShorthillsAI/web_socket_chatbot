    Handles WebSocket connections for querying.

    This WebSocket endpoint is designed to accept incoming WebSocket connections,
    receive JSON-encoded queries, process them, and send responses back to the client.
    It also handles errors gracefully and ensures the WebSocket connection is closed
    properly in case of an exception.

    Args:
        websocket (WebSocket): The WebSocket connection instance provided by FastAPI.

    Workflow:
    1. Accepts the WebSocket connection and logs the successful connection.
    2. Enters an infinite loop to continuously listen for incoming JSON messages.
    3. Parses the received JSON data into a `WebSocketQuery` object.
    4. Passes the parsed query, prompt, and parameters to the `handle_stream` function
       for further processing and streaming responses back to the client.
    5. Handles any exceptions that occur during the WebSocket communication or processing:
       - Logs the error with detailed information.
       - Sends an error message back to the client in JSON format.
       - Closes the WebSocket connection and logs the closure.

    Raises:
        Exception: Any exception that occurs during WebSocket communication or query handling
        is caught and logged, and the WebSocket connection is closed.

    Logging:
    - Logs the acceptance of the WebSocket connection.
    - Logs each received query in JSON format.
    - Logs any errors encountered during processing.
    - Logs the closure of the WebSocket connection in case of an error.

    Note:
    - The `WebSocketQuery` class is expected to define the structure of the incoming JSON data.
    - The `handle_stream` function is responsible for processing the query and sending responses.
